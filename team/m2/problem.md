# Problem Statement

## Problem Description

Many people want to learn a new language, be it for school, work, travel, or to meet new people and make friends. It's especially tough to understand the grammar of a new language, but to really become fluent, it's a necessity. While there are classes and other avenues to learn a language, not everyone has access to these options, but many of us have a phone or computer and an internet connection. We also feel that there is not frequently a focus on grammar in language learning, so we want to offer a solution that allows for specific targeting of grammar skills.

## Proposed Solution

Our web application will provide users with instruction on the grammar and structure of the language of their choice, along with ample opportunities to practice this new grammar, with exercises that are useful and visually appealing, allowing the user to improve their skills over time and work to build language fluency.

Key Features Include:

- **Educational Section**: Information and lessons about different grammar structures of the language and how they are used.
- **Interactive Exercises**: Exercises that are interesting and engaging, while providing the user with the ability to practice the skills they learned in the educational section.
- **Exception-based Learning**: Learning that allows users to focus on the grammatical exceptions in language, which are often a difficult part to learn as they don't follow the normal rules of that language.

We hope to provide engaging learning opportunities that help our users approach fluency in language, whether they are new to the language or a more advanced learner. 

## Why This Matters

Languages are essential tools for communicating with one another and we hope to improve the experience of anyone attempting to learn one. We want to help those who can't get formal tutoring of a language, as well as those who are looking for more knowledge and access to practice for the language they want to learn. Learning a new language is an incredibly difficult process, but also one that is rewarding and can open up new avenues in careers, education, and life as a whole. We hope our app will help those who are learning new languages improve on their skills in one of the most difficult areas of language, grammar.
