**Use Case**: 
This is an preliminary-stage diagram of our home page. As our app aims to focus on grammar (something most langauge-learning apps don't focus on), there are metrics that show how engaged the user is for motivational purposes. In addition, the home page serves as a landing base for the user, where they can also reorient themselves with reminders of goals they have set, as learning English is an arduous task.

**Use Case**: 
This is a preliminary-stage diagram of our Learning Page. This page focuses on all the mediums that will teach the user grammatical concepts. Two main grammatical subcategories we are choosing to focus on are puncutation and verb exceptions that are common in English. In addition, we plan to implement games that allow the user to learn in different ways.
