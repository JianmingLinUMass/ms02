**Use Case**: 
This is an preliminary-stage diagram of our home page. As our app aims to focus on grammar (something most langauge-learning apps don't focus on), there are metrics that show how engaged the user is for motivational purposes. In addition, the home page serves as a landing base for the user, where they can also reorient themselves with reminders of goals they have set, as learning English is an arduous task.

**Use Case**: 
This is a preliminary-stage diagram of our Learning Page. This page focuses on all the mediums that will teach the user grammatical concepts. Two main grammatical subcategories we are choosing to focus on are puncutation and verb exceptions that are common in English. In addition, we plan to implement games that allow the user to learn in different ways.

**Use Case**:  
This is a second version of the UI design in the web format, presenting the main page and the exercises/theory pages. Main page has three main components (exercises, theory and games) and a progress plant - a possible implementation idea to represent the user's progress, with the plant growing with every level. The exercises/theory page has levels you need to complete in order to finish the whole unit, the exercises unit unlocks after completing the according theory unit.
