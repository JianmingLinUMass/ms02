## Exercises

Medium feature (2 points)
A login page with input fields that require completion before logging in ensures users provide all of the necessary information required to access their progress in their account. A CSS file integrates containers for a better UI as well as a visually pleasing color scheme that is cohesive with the rest of the pages. An external link gives an option for new users to create an account, but has not been implemented as of 11/17/2024
