## Progress Tracking and Task Suggestion
A plant on the main page will grow as users complete exercises or games. This fun visual helps to gamify the website and encourage users to continue learning and develop their plant. Alongside this plant is a progress bar indicating what "level" users are on in terms of progress in completing tasks. Suggested immediate tasks are also displayed and clickable, which will allow users to jump straight into learning if they are unsure on what to do.

## Exercises 
Users will be able to engage in multiple-choice activities and fill-in-the-blank exercises which will increase in difficulty and complexity as they progress. Their progress will be tracked by the progress tracker. This will be the main way that users will test their knowledge and understanding of grammatical concepts.
