# Target Users

## Primary Audience

The primary users of our web application are non-native English speakers who need to use English on a daily basis. These users can be office workers aged 20-35 whose primary language is not English, but have to utilize proper English grammar in work. Another key audience for our application will be high school and college students who are not very familiar with English grammar, but are in the need to use them in school. They usually have a strong vocabulary base obtained from conversations with native English speakers and other existing language-learning applications, but less frequently, did they learn proper grammar from these sources. Many of these users who are eager to learn during their free time would appreciate a web or mobile app for extra English grammar supplement, since they won't have to adopt other approaches (purchasing books, spending time to browse, etc.) for this sole purpose.

## User Needs

Non-native English-speaking office workers face the challenge of utilizing vocabulary they learned efficiently when hosting meetings, giving presentations, preparing reports and other situations where they are required to speak and/or write out their progress in a clear manner, which usually have to be achieved in a short period. They need a tool that would help them not only enhance their memorization of previously learned grammar, but also discover and study new grammar that would come handy in work.

In a similar fashion, high school or college students who are not native in English have hard times choosing the right grammar to use when writing essays or having conversations with others in school. This poses a severe problem to them since not only does it require quite a lot of time to search for the correct grammar online, it could also leave the audience of their works a bad impression for incorrect usage of grammar. Although students could receive enlightening feedback from their English instructors, many of them would appreciate a tool dedicated just for grammar learning, for which they can utilize during breaks to learn grammar properly to improve their communication and academic writing skills, as well as getting more fluent in English.

## Why These Users Matter

These user groups are crucial to the success of our web app because they are the essential groups who pursue opportunities in English-speaking countries to improve their lives, but were hindered more or less by their lack of knowledge on utilizing grammar. For office workers, having good grammar practices not only allows them to efficiently use their time for preparation other than fixing grammar issues, it also makes sure that they don't leave a bad impression to their coworkers, boss or clients. For students, mastering grammar, especially those common but exceptional ones, benefit them with getting steady grades on writing. They would also become more fluent in English, which would greatly help them prepare for their future careers on job-hunting and daily interaction.

By addressing the specific needs of these users, our web app aims to offer an impactful solution which save their precious times from searching/correcting for the right grammar on their works. It would help them better adapt and integrate into schools, workplaces, and the English-speaking society as well.
