### Time 11/1/2024
- **Task**: Assigned ms03 assignments.
- **Details**: Lead a group discussion to decide who would do what during ms03. Our website planning indicated that we wanted to have 6 pages. As we had 7 people, we decide to split the work such that everyone is assigned one web page and will implement features for that page. As we had one more person than webpages, I would start work on the backend and then do a once over  of the front end after people pushed initial commits.

### Time 11/15/2024, 11/16/2024
- **Task**: Reorganized front end
- **Details**: Over a series of several commits, I made some adjustments and touch ups to the front end. I created folders for the quizzes and theory sections as those could become several files in the feature. All of the css for the theory page was inside the theory.html file, so i split it into its own css file. In addition, I  fixed a couple of typos (mostly in file paths).
