- **Task**: Implemented login.html and login.css
- **Details**: Added a username input field, password input field for user log in. Utilized CSS to implement a cohesive color scheme with the rest of the pages, and implemented color-changing for boxes on hover so users are able to better see what they are clicking. Added a link to sign up for new users to create new accounts, which will be fully implemented in the next milestone, when user account information and progress storing is fully implemented.
